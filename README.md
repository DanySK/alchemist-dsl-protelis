## Usage



To understand how to simulate, refer to the [Alchemist main project][alchemist-git] website instead.

### Basics

This incarnation allows for chemical-like manipulation of LSAs, that despite being semantic object in [SAPERE][SAPERE], here are treated as normal tuples. Various sorts of manipulation are supported, and elements of a tuples can be strings, numbers, or sets.

For a description of the LSA language, and the chemical-like rules format, please refer to the [SAPERE Domain-Specific Language][SAPERE-DSL] documentation.

#### Beware of the Context

It is important to return the correct ``Context``: a ``Context`` too wide will make the simulation slower (even of several orders of magnitude), a ``Context`` too strict will break the dependency graph, and consequently the simulation will be invalid. One frequent error in these cases is that events happen out of order, namely that the simulator at some point goes "back in time" and executes an old event.

* If the agent just wanders around (using the ``moveNode()`` method of ``IEnvironment``) and grabs informations from itself and the environment, then ``Context.LOCAL`` context is correct (and fast).
* If the agent injects or modifies LSAs in the neighborhood, then the user must also remember to return ``Context.NEIGHBORHOOD`` in the ``getContext()`` method.
* Finally, if the agent messes up with the LSAs in nodes which are not neighbors (in a SAPERE system, however, this should never happen), then the ``Context.GLOBAL`` is required.

#### Expose the modified LSA templates

If the agent modifies the LSA space content, then the user must take care of adding the LSA template it is modifying to the list of the outgoing dependencies.

If the agent inherits from ``AbstractAction``, it should be done by a call to ``addModifiedMolecule()`` inside the constructor of the new agent. The superclass will take care of announcing such dependency to the engine.

### Javadocs

Javadocs for latest build is available [here][Javadoc]. Please note that such documentation may be not in sync with the version you are importing in your project, even if you point at the latest release, since such documention is re-generated by our nightly build system and is updated with the latest commit (if the build passes).
The documentation for any specific version of this library is released on Maven Central along with the code and the compiled jar file.

## Notes for Developers


### Importing the project
The project has been developed using Eclipse, and can be easily imported in such IDE.


#### Recommended configuration
* Download [the latest Eclipse for Java SE developers][eclipse]. Arch Linux users can use the package extra/eclipse-java, which is rather up-to-date.
* Install the Gradle plug-in
	* In Eclipse, click Help -> Eclipse Marketplace...
	* In the search form enter "gradle", then press Enter
	* One of the retrieved entries should be "Gradle IDE Pack", click Install
	* Follow the instructions, accept the license, wait for Eclipse to download and install the product, accept the installation and restart the IDE.
* Install the FindBugs plug-in
	* In Eclipse, click Help -> Eclipse Marketplace...
	* In the search form enter "findbugs", then press Enter
	* One of the retrieved entries should be "FindBugs Eclipse Plugin", click Install
	* Follow the instructions, accept the license, wait for Eclipse to download and install the product, accept the installation and restart the IDE.
* Install the PMD plug-in
	* **Do not** install eclipse-pmd from the Eclipse Marketplace
	* In Eclipse, click Help -> Install New Software
	* In the text field labelled "Work with:", enter: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pmd/files/pmd-eclipse/update-site-latest/
	* Press Enter
	* PMD for Eclipse 4 will appear in the plugin list. Select it and click Next.
	* Follow the instructions, accept the license, wait for Eclipse to download and install the product, accept the installation and restart the IDE.
* Install the Checkstyle plug-in
	* In Eclipse, click Help -> Eclipse Marketplace...
	* In the search form enter "checkstyle", then press Enter
	* One of the retrieved entries should be "Checkstyle Plug-in" with a written icon whose text is "eclipse-cs", click Install
	* Follow the instructions, accept the license, wait for Eclipse to download and install the product, accept the installation and restart the IDE.


#### Import Procedure
* Open Eclipse
* Click File -> Import -> Git -> Projects from Git -> Next
* Clone URI -> Next
* Paste `git@github.com:DanySK/alchemist-incarnation-sapere.git` as URI -> Next -> Next
* Select the directory where you want to clone the repository. Beware that it **does not** point to the current Eclipse workspace by default
* Next -> Next -> Finish
* The project will appear in your projects list.
* Right click on the project, select Gradle -> Refresh Dependencies. If the option is disabled, do first Gradle -> Enable Dependency Management and then try again.
* Checkstyle, PMD and FindBugs should be pre-configured. **Do not** run Gradle -> Refresh all, because that would delete the automatic invocation of the code checkers.

### Developing the project
Contributions to this project are welcome. Just some rules:
1. Commit often. Do not throw at me pull requests with a single giant commit adding or changing the world. Split it in multiple commits and request a merge to the mainline often.
2. Do not introduce low quality code. All the new code must comply with the checker rules (that are quite strict) and must not introduce any other warning. Resolutions of existing warnings (if any is present) are very welcome instead.


#### Building the project
While developing, you can rely on Eclipse to build the project, it will generally do a very good job.
If you want to generate the artifacts, you can rely on Gradle. Just point a terminal on the project's root and issue

```bash
./gradlew
```

This will trigger the creation of the artifacts the executions of the tests, the generation of the documentation and of the project reports.


#### Release numbers explained
We release often. We are not scared of high version numbers, they are just numbers in the end.
We use a three levels numbering:

* **Update of the minor number**: there are some small changes, and no backwards compatibility is broken. Probably, it is better saying that there is nothing suggesting that any project that depends on this one may have any problem compiling or running. Raise the minor version if there is just a bug fix, or a code improvement, such that no interface, constructor, or non-private member of a class is modified either in syntax or in semantics. Also, no new classes should be provided.
	* Example: switch from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4 
* **Update of the middle number**: there are changes that should not break any backwards compatibility, but the possibility exists. Raise the middle version number if there is a remote probability that projects that depend upon this one may have problems compiling if they update. For instance, if you have added a new class, since a depending project may have already defined it, that is enough to trigger a mid-number change. Also updating the version ranges of a dependency, or adding a new dependency, should cause the mid-number to raise. As for minor numbers, no changes to interfaces, constructors or non-private member of classes are allowed. If mid-number is update, minor number should be reset to 0.
	* Example: switch from 1.2.3 to 1.3.0 
* **Update of the major number**: *non-backwards-compatible change*. If a change in interfaces, constructors, or public member of some class have happened, a new major number should be issued. This is also the case if the semantics of some method has changed. In general, if there is a high probability that projects depending upon this one may experience compile-time or run-time issues if they switch to the new version, then a new major number should be adopted. If the major version number is upgraded, the mid and minor numbers should be reset to 0.
	* Example: switch from 1.2.3 to 2.0.0
